## Closures

Closures are anonymous functions that work just like in javascript.
Closures can capture its environment and have their own scope.
They can also be anotated like this:  
`let add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -> u32 { x + 1 };`  
These are very useful when combining them with functions that operate
over a list of values just like `map` or `filter`, a good example could be:

![a function returning the most stocked value](/posts/rust/ex5-1.png)

In this function we can see how to use a closure to get a value from
the `user_preference` struct. The `unwrap_or_else` tells Rust that
we want the value on the `user_preference` argument if it's not
Nil, in case it is, run `x` function, in this case a closure that
uses `self` to get the most stocked item.

## Iterators

Iterators in Rust are lazy, they don't do anything unless consumed
by the user. Iterators take ownership of the values they are iterating
on, for example a foor l

A _consuming adaptor_ is a method that calls the `next` method
of an iterator, because calling it uses up the iterator.
_Iterator adaptors_ are methods that don't consume the iterator.
Instead, they produce different iterators. An example of this is
`map`. `map` in Rust returns a new iterator.

We can use `collect()` to get a collection back from an iterator,
this is useful when using an _iterator adaptor_ since what you
get back from them are other iterators after your closure has
done the job. An example of this could be:

![function that iterates over an integer vector and adds one](/posts/rust/ex5-2.png)

This function takes a reference to an integer vector, turns it into
an iterator, maps the values to add one into a new iterator and then
calls the collect method to send a collection once again. This is not
necessarily the best function to make since this could also be done
in place.

## Publishing and Workspaces

In this chapter of the book we learn how to optimize your build by
specifying the amount of optimizations the rust compiler should make
when compiling your code in production or development. This is done
by writing down on the specific profile part in the `Cargo.toml` file.
Since the optimizations are done in compiling time this does not affect
the final product in terms of speed of starting the program.

`///` is used to document functions or any part of the code.

If you have documentation in your code, structs, functions or any kind
of type, you can open a documentation page with all of your writings by
writing `cargo doc --open`. The files for that page will be on the folder
called `target/doc`. If you write an example in the documentation of the
code it will also be counted as a test when running `cargo test`.

Workspaces are used when you have to manage multiple packages for a same
project, for example, having two libraries and one binary. When on a workspace,
all the libraries will output the compiled artifacts on the parent's
`target` directory.

## Smart Pointers

Rust has some _smart pointers_ options, a smart pointer is a pointer that
can do more that the basic capability of pointing to a place in the stack.
For example, `String` and `Vec<T>` are both smart pointers, besides the
reference they have on the heap, they also contain metadata about the value.
One main diference between those smart pointers and a simple reference is that
these pointers own the value in the heap instead of just being borrowed.

A smart pointer often used is the `Box<T>`, this allows to save any type/value
in the heap instead of the stack, a great use for this is moving data from
a variable to another and transfer just the ownership of the place in the stack
instead of copying the data over.

There are two traits that create a smart pointers which are `Deref` and `Drop`.

- `Deref` is the trait that allows a struct to be dereferenced, this uses the
  deref operator `*`. The deref trait needs a function called `deref` to be implemented
  which tells Rust how will that instance be treated when trying to dereference it.
- `Drop` is a kind of destructor, when implemented it lets Rust knows how to deal
  with the instance/value when it's being dropped.
