## Rust

Rust

The first thing that got my attention was [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
which is Rust's package manager and build system. It's pretty easy to
use and it comes overcharged right out of the gate with a way
to initialize and run new projects by just one command each.
The rust-analizer extension in [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
makes development so much easier, it features a server to start your new
projects and inline visualization of typings (which I think is an awesome
feature).

## Common programming concepts

Rust is a very clear language when it comes write code in it, nothing
we have seen before. Declaring variables is very straightforward and
typing is not required. Here is an example:

![declaration and printing of a variable](/posts/rust/ex1-1.png)

It looks weird if you come from something like javascript but this is
just getting a random number from a range from 1 to 100.

Also, a simple example of functions and control flow with `if`:

Loops are expressions in Rust, that means that they can return
a value, which is crazy. You can do things like running a loop
and assigning a value that could come out of it once the loop
has finished. I know that in javascript you have things like `map`
and `forEach` to run throught a whole array and return the array,
and also `reduce` so we could get a single value, but this is
like you could assign a for to a variable. And it looks like this:

Here is where it starts to get difficult.

## Compiler

Rust's compiler is a time saver, even though there is a learning
curve in dealing with errors just as you write them without
them being blatanly obvious, like a syntax error or a type
error, Rust's compiler catches the strangest of bugs that could
happen in the future. This comes to the expense of

Which I believe is a great tradeoff for what the type safety you
are getting.
