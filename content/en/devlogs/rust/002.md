## Rust

The first thing that got my attention was [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
which is Rust's package manager and build system. It's pretty easy to
use and it comes overcharged right out of the gate with a way
to initialize and run new projects by just one command each.
The rust-analizer extension in [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
makes development so much easier, it features a server to start your new
projects and inline visualization of typings (which I think is an awesome
feature).

## Common programming concepts

Rust is a very clear language when it comes write code in it, nothing
we have seen before. Declaring variables is very straightforward and
typing is not required. Here is an example:

![declaration and printing of a variable](/posts/rust/ex1-1.png)

It looks weird if you come from something like javascript but this is
just getting a random number from a range from 1 to 100.

Also, a simple example of functions and control flow with `if`:

![code of a function with control flow](/posts/rust/ex1-2.png)

Loops are expressions in Rust, that means that they can return
a value, which is crazy. You can do things like running a loop
and assigning a value that could come out of it once the loop
has finished. I know that in javascript you have things like `map`
and `forEach` to run throught a whole array and return the array,
and also `reduce` so we could get a single value, but this is
like you could assign a for to a variable. And it looks like this:

## Ownership

Here is where it starts to get difficult.

Rust's compiler handles a concept called [Ownership](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html).
Ownership is the way Rust ensures the code is "safe", by safe it
means that the code is not doing anything that could cause undefined
behaviour, things like using memory that has already been freed or
freeing memory before its use.

To figure out how to write safe code you have to do some [mental
gymnastics](https://tenor.com/view/michael-scott-flip-couch-parkour-the-office-gif-8710113)
about which variable has write, read or ownership of data in the
[heap](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)>). It
is difficult for me since I've been working with javascript for years
now without having to worry about memory allocation, but it's part
of why I wanted to learn Rust in the first place.

At the end of the day, understanding pointers, memory allocation,
and data structures is benefitial to me. Those are foundations that
in a way I skipped by not finishing college and not actually needing
them in my day to day writing React code.

## Compiler

Rust's compiler is a time saver, even though there is a learning
curve in dealing with errors just as you write them without
them being blatanly obvious, like a syntax error or a type
error, Rust's compiler catches the strangest of bugs that could
happen in the future. This comes at the expense of having to
carefully detail and think about the consequences the code you are
writing could have.

Which I believe is a great tradeoff for the memory safe and secure
code you are getting.
