My name is Kendry Grull√≥n! I am a software developer from the Dominican Republic.
I started creating software in highschool with assignments such as the Fibonacci sequence,
a simple calculator and guessing a number games, all in C++!

I am now a web developer (ew) who has forgotten a lot of things related to how computers work
and how we interface with them so I decided to start building small applications that could teach
me something about software.

I have recently developed an appreciation for good accesibility and UX which I will apply on
the products I'm building.

## Tech Stack

I've been working as a web developer for the past 7 years, mostly as a full stack within the
javascript environment. The frameworks I'm most comfortable are React and Node.js but I've worked
with many more.

## Fun facts

- My dream software is actually a 3D game of Dominoes.
- I love sports and I suck at all of them.
- I sincerely think I'm funny.
